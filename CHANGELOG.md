## [6.0.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added
- **Model-scoped weekly limits in the Quota views** (#8) — the "Weekly Fable" line from Claude Code's `/usage` panel now appears in the status-bar tooltip (`· Fable (7d): 63% - resets in 2d 4h`) and as an extra card in the dashboard's Usage Windows & Quota section. It renders only when your plan reports such a limit, and the label comes from the data, so other models (or several at once) are shown too. The value counts toward the status bar's amber/red warning colour.
  - This bucket is not in the `/v1/messages` rate-limit headers, only in `GET /api/oauth/usage`, which is aggressively rate-limited. Clusage therefore reads Claude Code's on-disk copy of that response (`~/.claude.json`) as the primary source and calls the live endpoint at most every 15 minutes, backing off 30 minutes on a 429. The last known value is kept across a failed read until it resets, so the line doesn't flicker. Thanks to @jstonge640 for the investigation and original patch.
- **Pricing for Claude Fable 5.1** — $10.00 / $50.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $12.50 (5m) / $20.00 (1h); cache read $0.25. Previously matched the Fable 5 entry and was priced with Fable 5's $1.00 cache read.
- **Pricing for Claude Opus 5.5** — $4.00 / $20.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $5.00 (5m) / $8.00 (1h); cache read $0.20. Previously matched the Opus 5 entry ($5 / $25).
- **Pricing for Claude Sonnet 5.5** — $2.00 / $10.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $2.50 (5m) / $4.00 (1h); cache read $0.10.
- **Pricing for Claude Haiku 5.5** — two rate cards chosen per request by prompt length (all input tokens, including cache reads and writes): up to 100K tokens $0.10 / $0.50, cache write $0.125 (5m) / $0.20 (1h), cache read $0.01; over 100K tokens $0.50 / $2.50, cache write $0.625 / $1.00, cache read $0.05. Previously fell through to the $3 / $15 default.

### Changed
- **Claude Sonnet 5 stays at $2.00 / $10.00** — Anthropic made the launch "introductory" rate the standard price and cancelled the increase to $3 / $15 that was scheduled for 2026-09-01. Sonnet 5 usage from 2026-09-01 onward had been priced at the higher rate and is now recalculated at $2 / $10; costs for that period will drop accordingly.

### Fixed
- **Windows project rows showed an unreadable, identical path instead of the project name** (#7) — `projectDisplayName` split the session's `cwd` on `/` only. A Windows path (`C:\Users\me\Downloads\repos\my-app`) contains no forward slash, so it was treated as a single segment and rendered in full, then clipped with an ellipsis at the *end* — cutting off exactly the folder that identifies the project and leaving every row reading `C:\Users\me\Downloads\repos\...`. Paths are now split on both separators, so the name is the last two segments (`repos/my-app`) on every platform. A path directly under a drive root shows just the folder (`C:\dev` → `dev`).

### Added
- **Full project path on hover** (#7) — project rows in the Projects tab and session rows in the Sessions tab carry a tooltip with the complete path, so the truncated name can always be resolved to a real directory.
- **Full path shown under the project name** — the Projects tab lists each project's complete path on a dim second line beneath its name.
- **Project and session filters now match the full path** — typing any part of a path (`Downloads`, a drive letter, a parent folder) filters on it, not just on the shortened display name.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Dashboard reset to the Overview tab on every background refresh** (#6) — `refreshDashboard` reassigned the webview's `.html`, which fully reloads the page and discards all client-side state. Reopening the dashboard from the status bar while it was already open did the same thing. The dashboard now keeps a single long-lived page and pushes fresh data to it via `postMessage`; the active tab, project/session search text, sort order, and model filter all survive refreshes and reopens.

### Added
- **`clusage.showCostInStatusBar` setting** (#4) — disables the cost figure in the status bar text and tooltip for users on a fixed-price plan who only care about quota usage.
- **`clusage.disableRefreshAnimation` setting** (#5) — disables the dashboard's fade-in animations so refreshes update the numbers in place without redrawing the UI. Applies immediately when toggled, no reload required.
- **Pricing for Claude Opus 5** — $5.00 / $25.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $6.25 (5m) / $10.00 (1h); cache read $0.50
- **Pricing for Claude Sonnet 5** — introductory rate through 2026-08-31: $2.00 / $10.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $2.50 (5m) / $4.00 (1h); cache read $0.20. Reverts automatically to list pricing ($3.00 / $15.00; cache write $3.75 / $6.00; cache read $0.30) for any request timestamped 2026-09-01 or later — each usage record is priced by its own timestamp, not by today's date, so past and future usage are both priced correctly regardless of when the dashboard is opened.

### Removed
- **Pricing table trimmed to the four currently-accessible models** — Claude Fable 5, Opus 5, Sonnet 5, and Haiku 4.5. Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7/4.8/4, Sonnet 4.x, Haiku 3.x, and the Claude 3.x line have been retired and are no longer served, so their pricing entries were removed; any unrecognized model ID falls back to the Sonnet-5-equivalent default rate ($3 / $15 per MTok) instead of a per-model entry.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Pricing for Claude Fable 5** — $10.00 / $50.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $12.50 (5m) / $20.00 (1h); cache read $1.00
- **Pricing for Claude Opus 4.8** — $5.00 / $25.00 input/output per MTok; cache write $6.25 (5m) / $10.00 (1h); cache read $0.50

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- **Status bar showed `5h:0% 7d:0%` despite real quota usage** — recent Claude Code releases use OAuth tokens (`sk-ant-oat…`) that the Anthropic API now strictly validates per header. Sending the same token in both `authorization: Bearer …` and `x-api-key: …` causes the API to reject the request with `401 invalid x-api-key`. The rate-limit headers are absent on that response, so `fetchQuota` was falling through and returning `utilization=0` for both windows. The duplicate `x-api-key` header has been removed and the OAuth beta header (`anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`) is now sent, matching the current Claude Code request shape. Real `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` / `7d-utilization` values are now read correctly.
- **Silent fallback to 0% on auth/server failure** — any non-2xx response without rate-limit headers now returns `null` from `fetchQuota` instead of a fake `{ utilization: 0, … }` payload. The status bar now shows cost-only on quota failure (e.g. expired OAuth token, offline, API outage) rather than misleadingly reporting full quota remaining.

### Changed
- **Recursive JSONL scanning** — `parser.ts` now walks subdirectories under each project folder so subagent transcripts under `<sessionId>/subagents/` are included in usage totals.

---

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- **Dashboard fully revamped** — replaced the single-scroll page with a tabbed SPA (Overview / Projects / Sessions / Models):
  - **Overview** — hero cards with split integer/decimal cost display; Today's Token Breakdown section (Input, Output, Cache Read, Cache Write); Usage Windows & Quota cards with window labels; compact By Model cards with SVG donut ring charts; All-Time Token Breakdown
  - **Projects tab** — searchable, client-side sortable table (Cost / Tokens / Sessions / Name) with per-project colour-coded dots and share-of-spend bars
  - **Sessions tab** — filterable by model pill and text search; colour-coded project dots consistent with the Projects tab
  - **Models tab** — three summary cards (Total Spend, Total Tokens, Requests) plus full-width detail cards with donut rings
- **Color system aligned with claude-deck** — dashboard now uses VS Code theme variables (`--vscode-editor-background`, `--vscode-editor-foreground`, etc.) so it adapts to light/dark themes; accent updated to `#d97757`
- **TODAY hero card highlighted** — distinct border and tinted background using `--accent-line` / `--accent-bg`; all other hero card values are white
- **Today's Token Breakdown added** — new section in the Overview tab showing today's per-type token counts alongside the existing all-time breakdown
- **Sparkline charts removed** — hero cards show clean cost values without decorative line graphs
- **Startup loading indicator** — status bar shows an animated `$(sync~spin) Claude...` spinner on launch instead of stale cached values; live data replaces it once the first scan completes

### Added
- **`todayTokenBreakdown`** — per-type token counts scoped to today, surfaced in the new Today's Tokens section
- **`last7DayCosts`** — rolling 7-day daily cost array (used internally for future sparkline support)
- **`prevWeekCost` / `prevMonthCost`** — previous-period costs for week-over-week and month-over-month comparisons

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Duplicate message counting (~1.73× overcount)** — Claude Code appends the same final assistant message to the JSONL multiple times under different outer UUIDs. Added deduplication by `message.id` so each API response is counted exactly once, cutting inflated token and cost totals roughly in half.
- **Wrong cache write tier pricing (~45% undercount)** — the JSONL `usage.cache_creation` object exposes two write tiers: `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` (1.25× base) and `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens` (2.0× base). Claude Code uses 1-hour caching by default, so virtually all cache writes were hitting the 1h tier. The old code read only the flat `cache_creation_input_tokens` total and priced everything at the cheaper 5m rate. Both tiers are now read and priced independently.
- **`formatCost` showing `$0.50¢`** — sub-cent amounts were rendered with both a `$` prefix and a `¢` suffix. Now correctly rendered as `0.50¢`.
- **`timeUntil` day boundary off-by-one** — `h > 24` changed to `h >= 24` so exactly 24 hours shows `1d 0h` instead of `24h 0m`.
- **Status bar tooltip showed all-time tokens under "Today" heading** — input/output token breakdown is now clearly separated into an "All Time" section.
- **`resetRefreshTimer` not cleared on deactivate** — dangling timeout after extension disable is now cleaned up in `deactivate()`.

### Changed
- **Pricing table updated to current Anthropic rates:**
  - Claude Opus 4.5 / 4.6 / 4.7 repriced to $5 / $25 per MTok (was $15 / $75)
  - Claude Haiku 4.5 repriced to $1 / $5 per MTok (was $0.80 / $4)
  - Added explicit entries for `claude-opus-4-5/4-6/4-7` before the generic `claude-opus-4` prefix to fix prefix-match ordering bug
  - Added `claude-haiku-3-5` entry for new-style Haiku 3.5 model IDs
  - Added 1h cache write price column to all models in the pricing table
- **Status bar color** — item is now colored by quota urgency: purple (normal), amber (≥ 70%), red (≥ 90%)
- **Status bar tooltip redesigned** — clean line-by-line format with `---` dividers before Quota and Streak sections; shows today's message count and streak days
- **Dashboard header** — replaced 📊 emoji with the actual `icon.png` extension icon via `webview.asWebviewUri`

### Added
- **`todayMessages`** — count of API messages sent today, shown in the status bar tooltip
- **`streakDays`** — consecutive calendar days with any Claude Code usage, shown in the status bar tooltip
- **Separate `cacheWrite5mTokens` / `cacheWrite1hTokens` fields** on `UsageRecord` for accurate per-tier cost calculation

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Weekly quota preserved on session reset** - when the 5-hour window resets and a fresh quota fetch returns without a `7d-utilization` header, the previous weekly utilization is now carried forward instead of being zeroed out

### Changed
- **Faster quota updates** - quota now refreshes ~1 second after each Claude Code API response (triggered by JSONL file writes), down from a fixed 5-minute poll. The 5-minute interval remains as a fallback when Claude Code is idle.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Status bar now shows 5h session time remaining alongside quota percentage: `$(graph) $3.70  5h:46% $(clock)1h23m  7d:6%`

### Fixed
- **Instant load on startup** - last known usage and quota are cached in `globalState` and restored immediately when VS Code opens, so the status bar is never blank while waiting for network/disk
- **Stale quota after reset** - if a quota window's reset time already passed while VS Code was closed, utilization is shown as 0% on restore rather than the old cached value

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- README images updated to absolute GitHub raw URLs so they render correctly on the VS Code Marketplace page
- Added dashboard screenshot to README

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Quota auto-reset** - extension now schedules a refresh exactly 2 seconds after each quota window resets, so the UI clears itself immediately instead of waiting up to 5 minutes
- **429 handling** - when the API returns 429 with no rate-limit headers, quota is correctly marked as "Limit reached" with a red bar rather than silently showing `< 0.1%`
- **Bar overflow** - quota progress bar is now capped at 100% width; over-limit state shows "Limit reached" label in red
- **Status bar over-limit** - status bar now shows `5h:maxed` instead of a percentage above 100%

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Professional marketplace icon featuring Claude AI sparkle mark
- Full README with feature documentation, pricing reference, and privacy policy

### Fixed
- **Accurate cost calculation** - intermediate streaming messages (`stop_reason: null`) were being counted alongside final messages, inflating costs by ~1.5–2×. Only final messages are now counted.
- **Sub-1% quota display** - quota utilisation values below 1% were rounded to "0% used". They now display with one decimal place (e.g. "0.3% used") or "< 0.1%" for very small values.

### Changed
- Status bar now shows live session and weekly quota percentages instead of token count: `$(graph) $3.70  5h:46%  7d:6%`
- Status bar icon changed from `$(hubot)` to `$(graph)`
- Hover tooltip reformatted as aligned Markdown tables with quota reset times

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Status bar item** - shows today's cost and live quota at a glance; click to open the dashboard
- **Dashboard webview** - full-screen panel with:
  - Hero cards: all-time, today, this week, this month spend
  - Live quota cards: current session (5 h) and weekly utilisation pulled directly from Anthropic API response headers - no manual configuration required
  - Token breakdown: input, output, cache read, cache write with percentage bars
  - Projects table sorted by cost
  - Per-model breakdown cards
  - Recent sessions list with relative timestamps
- **Auto-refresh** - file-system watcher on `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` triggers a refresh within 500 ms of any new Claude Code activity
- **Quota polling** - quota data is re-fetched from the Anthropic API every 5 minutes using the OAuth token stored in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
- **Zero configuration** - reads Claude Code's own credential and project files; nothing to set up
- Cross-platform support: Linux, macOS, Windows (including WSL)
