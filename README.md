## ✨ Overview

Claude Usage connects to Claude Code's local session files and your Anthropic API quota headers to give you **instant visibility** into:

- 💰 How much you've spent — today, this week, this month, all time
- 📊 Which projects and models are driving your costs
- ⚡ Live quota consumption for your current session and weekly limit
- 🔢 Token breakdown across input, output, cache read, and cache write

Zero configuration. No API keys. No accounts. It just works.

## 🖥️ Status Bar

The status bar item updates in real time as you use Claude Code:

```
⬡  $4.26  5h:60%  7d:8%
```

| Segment | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `$4.26` | Your total spend today |
| `5h:60%` | Current session quota used — live from Anthropic API headers |
| `7d:8%` | Weekly quota used — live from Anthropic API headers |

**Hover** over the item for a detailed breakdown table. **Click** to open the full dashboard.

## 📋 Dashboard

Open with a click on the status bar item or via the Command Palette:

> **Claude Usage: Open Dashboard** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)

The dashboard is a beautiful dark-themed panel with six sections:

### 💳 Spend Overview

Four hero cards showing your costs at every time horizon:

| Card | Period |
|---|---|
| **All Time** | Every session ever recorded |
| **Today** | Since midnight, local time |
| **This Week** | Rolling 7-day window |
| **This Month** | Calendar month to date |

---

### ⚡ Usage Windows & Live Quota

Three cards showing rolling usage windows — the first two powered by **live Anthropic API rate-limit headers**, the same data shown on `claude.ai/settings/usage`:

| Card | Data Source |
|---|---|
| **Current Session (5h)** | `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` response header |
| **Weekly** | `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-utilization` response header |
| **Last Hour** | Computed from local JSONL session data |

Each quota card shows:
- Spend and token count for that window
- An animated progress bar that turns **amber at 70%** and **red at 90%**
- Exact reset countdown (`Resets in 1h 28m`)
- Percentage used with one decimal place for precision

No manual limits to configure — quota is read directly from Anthropic's API.

---

### 🔢 Token Breakdown

All-time token totals split into four types with proportional colour-coded bars:

| Type | Description | Typical Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Non-cached prompt tokens | Mid |
| **Output** | Generated response tokens | Highest |
| **Cache Read** | Prompt tokens served from cache | Lowest |
| **Cache Write** | Prompt tokens written to cache | Low–Mid |

---

### 📁 Projects

A sortable table of every project you've used Claude Code in, ranked by total spend:

- Project name (derived from session working directory)
- Session count
- Total token count
- Total cost with a relative bar chart

---

### 🤖 By Model

Per-model cards showing spend, token usage, and request count. Instantly see whether **Claude Opus 4.6** or **Sonnet 4.6** is driving your bill.

---

### 🕐 Recent Sessions

The 20 most recent sessions showing:
- Project name
- Model used (tagged pill)
- Session cost
- Token count
- Relative timestamp (`2m ago`, `21h ago`, `6d ago`)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Claude Code writes a `.jsonl` file for every conversation under `~/.claude/projects/`. Claude Usage:

1. **Scans** all `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` files on startup
2. **Filters** to final assistant messages only (`stop_reason != null`) — avoids double-counting the streaming header that carries duplicate token counts
3. **Computes cost** locally using published Anthropic per-token pricing
4. **Watches** for new writes with a file-system watcher — refreshes within 500 ms of any Claude Code activity
5. **Fetches live quota** on startup and every 5 minutes by making a 1-token API call to `api.anthropic.com` and reading the `anthropic-ratelimit-*` response headers — uses the OAuth token already stored in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`

The dashboard and status bar stay in sync automatically. No polling loops, no manual refreshes.

## 🔒 Privacy

| What | Detail |
|---|---|
| Data storage | All session data is read **locally** from `~/.claude/` — nothing is uploaded |
| Outbound requests | One minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` (max_tokens=1, ~$0.000001) every 5 minutes, used solely to read rate-limit headers |
| Analytics | None |
| Telemetry | None |
| Third-party services | None |

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Cost figures are **estimates** — actual invoices may differ due to plan discounts, overages, or pricing changes
- Quota figures reflect your **Claude.ai / Claude Code plan limits**, not raw Anthropic API key limits
- Sessions interrupted mid-stream may show incomplete costs until Claude Code flushes the JSONL file
- The extension requires Claude Code to be signed in via OAuth — API-key-only setups will show usage data but no live quota
